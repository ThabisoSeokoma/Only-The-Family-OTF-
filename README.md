Welcome to the OTF repository! This is a software design project aimed at developing an app to monitor the ACWR (Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio) in athletes. Our goal is to produce a reliable and efficient software to assist team health professionals, coaches, and captains in best balancing the needs of the athletes and the team.
This project is run using Expo and React Native. We used this for both IOS and Android usage.
